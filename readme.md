# project creator
A simple python script I made to automatically initialise a python project for me. It automatically sets up a .gitignore, my pyright and pylint configs, and requirements.txt, and main.py for python projects.

To use it simply add this directory to PATH on windows and run init-py-proj to create a new project.
